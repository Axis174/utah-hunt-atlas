"""Source registry. Everything the refresh job pulls, in one place.

Rules of the road:
  * Only official / public / API-sanctioned sources.
  * No social-media scraping. Facebook and Instagram are auth-walled and their
    terms forbid it; anything built on them breaks in weeks and risks the account.
    Reddit has a real API and most forums publish RSS - those are used instead.
