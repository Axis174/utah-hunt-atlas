"""Build docs/data/draw_odds.json from UDWR's published draw result PDFs.

UDWR prints one block per hunt code: a row per point level, residents on the
left and nonresidents on the right, then a Totals row. This reads the text layer
(pdftotext -layout), keeps only point levels that had applicants, and CHECKS
ITSELF: every hunt's rows must add up to its own Totals row, and the odds
recomputed from applicants and permits must match the ratio UDWR printed. A hunt
that fails either check is reported and left out rather than shipped wrong.

Run by hand once a year after UDWR posts results (late May / June):
    python3 scraper/build_odds.py
Needs `pdftotext` (brew install poppler). Not part of the daily job.
